Hey hey! :raised_hands:

I'm Pien, a PhD candidate at Radboud University, where I'm working on the project *Find2Fix: reducing software errors using transparent AI*. My research sits at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, and Software Engineering. If you want to know more about my research check out my [website](prooijendijk.nl).

Also! Check out my [tutorial](https://gist.github.com/pcrooijendijk/ea8e9dfb8ee59acdb454da10bab22530) on how to use Ollama in Python :relaxed:
